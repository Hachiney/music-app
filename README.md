# Music-app

Tech Stack: Recat.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Rapid API.

I built this modern React.js music application with an exceptional design just like Spotify to deliver a seamless streaming experience with the features like top-charts, top-artists, search, Select by genre, lyrics & related songs. I used my React, Tailwind CSS & Redux toolkit skills using an external API from Rapid to fetch the data and execute it in a professional and entirely responsive music application.
